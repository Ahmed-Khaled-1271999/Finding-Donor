# Finding-Donor
CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause, Many Supervised Classifiers are trained to predict the income scale of a person either greater than 50k or at most 50k to start sending Emails to people >50k. <br>

My Contributions:<br>
* Features are Engineered by Normalizing Numerical Features Scale and Distribution, also Categories-to-Numerical Transformations are done. all with aid of the power of Visualization, we got out 105 features out of the original 33!
* Trained a variety of Supervised Classifiers, almost everyone I learned for the sake of Models exploration, and used Techniques like Boosting & Bagging which prove its Magic.
* Optimized The Model in terms of picking the best Complexity through Cross Validation and Grid Search, and in terms of Feature Selections and Dimensionality Reduction.
* Succeeded to get Accuracy (even more Importantly F-score due to biased Predicted Class ) __. __ % higher than any of my peers on the Scholarship.
